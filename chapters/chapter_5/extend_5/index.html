                <h2>Sticky</h2>
                <p>This is an example of an element with a sticky position. Its position is based on the user's scroll position.</p>
                <!-- Use the empty paragraph element below to briefly explain how to use the sticky position. -->
                <p>A sticky element toggles between relative and fixed, depending on the scroll position.</p>
                
            </div>
            
            <div class="box relative">
                
                <h2>Relative</h2>
                <p>This is an example of an element with a relative position. It can move around a little, depending on the viewport, but it is in a position relative to itself.</p>
                <!-- Use the empty paragraph element below to identify the values you used for the top and left properties and how it affected the relative box. -->
                <p>For the top property, I used 90 pixels. For the left property, I used 30 pixels. 
                Setting the top, right, bottom, left, properties of a relatively-positioned element will cause it to be adjusted away from its normal position.</p>
                
            </div>
            
            <div class="box fixed">
            
                <h2>Fixed</h2>
                <p>This is an example of an element with a fixed position. Its position is relative to the viewport.</p>
                <!-- Use the empty paragraph element below to identify the values you used for the top and right properties and how it affected the fixed box. -->
                <p>For the top property, I used 90 pixels. For the right property, I used 10 pixels. 
                A fixed element does not leave as gap in the page where it would normally have been located.</p>
                
            </div>
            
            <div class="box absolute">
                
                <h2>Absolute</h2>
                <p>This is an example of an element with an absolute position. It is similar to the fixed position; however, it is positioned relative to the closest parent element.</p>
                <!-- Use the empty paragraph element below to identify the values you used for the bottom and right properties and how it affected the absolute box. -->
                <p>For the bottom property, I used 0 pixels. For the right property, I used 0 pixels. 
                Abosulte positioned elements are removed from the normal flow, and can overlap elements.</p>
